        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5 cups (1.2 litres) water</li>
          <li>2 stalks of lemongrass</li>
          <li>2 shallots, peeled and cut in half</li>
          <li>
            A piece of galangal about 4 cm (1.5 inches) long, cut into slices
          </li>
          <li>4 kaffir lime leaves, ribs removed</li>
          <li>1 medium tomato, cut into 8 wedges and seeds removed</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoons Asian chili paste</li>
          <li>
            250 grams (9 oz) mixed Asian mushrooms (I used shimeji, shiitake and
            baby oyster but other varieties or white button mushrooms will do),
            larger ones sliced
          </li>
          <li>3 â€“ 4 tablespoons lime juice (about 2 limes)</li>
          <li>5 cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered</li>
          <li>A small handful of fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Bring the water to a boil in a medium-sized pot.</li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, smash the lemongrass lightly with the back of your knife
            or a pestle and cut it into 3 or 4 pieces to fit in your pot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the lemongrass, shallots, galangal, lime leaves and chopped
            tomato to the water and boil for 5 minutes or until you have a
            fragrant, herbal broth. Smash the tomatoes with your spoon as they
            cook so that they meld into the broth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the soy sauce, sugar, chili paste and mushrooms. Bring the soup
            back to the boil then turn off the heat. If youâ€™re using button
            mushrooms, you may want to boil the soup for a couple of minutes
            until theyâ€™re soft.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the lime juice and taste the broth. Adjust the seasonings to
            reach a balance of salty, sweet, spicy and sour, if necessary.
            Finally add the cherry tomatoes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the soup into bowls, avoiding the lemongrass, galangal and
            lime leaves as they are not edible. Garnish with some fresh
            cilantro.
          </li>
        </ol>
